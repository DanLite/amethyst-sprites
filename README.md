## TODO

- allow admins to flag (with comment) finished sprites needing a revamp
  - ability to flag directly from gallery page
- better user pages to show their contributions and current work
- user settings page to change email/password, set time zone
- improved activity feed with less redundant content
  - possibly show only one instance of a particular Pok√©mon, with its latest status
- handle sprites with semi-transparent pixels (and possibly try to threshold the alpha on them)
- show differences made by sprite edits, probably by cycling through each sprite
